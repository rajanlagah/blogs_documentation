## NFT Ranking

import ImgLoader from '../../../components/ImgLoader'

<ImgLoader type="nft_landing_page" />

###  Project description
For past many years we see increase intrest in NFTs. Which is good thing but due this marketplace is now flooded with Millions of NFTs.
Most of which wont give you any return. So now problem is how will you find best NFT to buy? 

Marketplaces now days are doing ranking system which calculates rarity of NFT. Higher the score more likely that NFT will give better returns.
Even if you dont care about returns you want to have rare and special NFT to buy.

In this project I did same thing. I took 1 [Impostors Genesis Aliens](https://opensea.io/collection/impostors-genesis-aliens) collection and sort them on the basis of thier rarity

> I have also implemented infinte scroll and load images automatically when someone reaches the end of the page.

### Technologies used

- Moralis
- Python
- Pandas

### Code walk through

[GitHub â†—](https://github.com/rajanlagah/NFTRanking/tree/main)

*Python code to import NFTs*

```python {2,19}
for x in range(noOfReqs):
    result = evm_api.nft.get_contract_nfts(
        api_key,
        params={
            "address":nftContract,
            "chain":"eth",
            "cursor": cursor
        }
    )

    cursor = result["cursor"]
    df2 = json_normalize(result["result"])

    if(df.empty):
        df = df2
    else:
        df = pd.concat([df,df2])
    print(x + 1, " / ", noOfReqs)
    time.sleep(0.21)
```
We are calling Moralis EVM apis and those have ratelimit so to we added sleep time after which we call Moralis API to prevent quota breach.

*JS component to fetch more imgs on page end*

```javascript {23}
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import styles from "./../styles/Home.module.css";

const LoadMoreImgs = ({ cb, isCbLoading, cursor }) => {
  const loadingBtnRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    const threshHold = window.screen.height + 450;
    const debouncedAPICall = debouncing(cb, functionDelay);
    const onScroll = (e) => {
      const loadingBtnLocation =
        loadingBtnRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().y;
      if (loadingBtnLocation < threshHold && !isCbLoading) {
        debouncedAPICall();
      }
    };
    window.addEventListener("scroll", onScroll);

    return () => window.removeEventListener("scroll", onScroll);
  }, [cursor]);

  const functionDelay = 500; // ms
  const debouncing = (fn, delay) => {
    let timer;
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timer);
      timer = setTimeout(function () {
        fn(cursor);
      }, delay);
    };
  };

  return (
    <div ref={loadingBtnRef} className={styles["im-card"]}>
      .
    </div>
  );
};

export default LoadMoreImgs;
```

- We are using `scroll` event to detect user scrolling.
- we have 450px of threshHold which means imgs will start loading when current page end is 450px below the bottom of visible screen
- We have debounce function which ensure we are not calling API to fetch data multiple times on threshHold breach.

### Ranking logic
1. Calculate Number of NFTs ( T )
2. Calculate Number of NFTs having perticular feature ( lets say it F1 )
3. Do it for features score ( 1/(F1/T) and call it S1 now F1 have score S1)
4. Calculate score for all features (  S1 , S2 , S3 .... )
5. List features available in NFT ( lets say NFT_1 have F1 , F3 , F4 and F10 features)
6. Calculate score by S1 + S3 + S4 + S10

### Future scope
Right now I am using only 1 collection. But we can 
1. Do same for more collections so users have option to choose collections.
2. Take NFT collection address from user as input then calculates and display results for that NFT collection.
